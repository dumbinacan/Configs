# dumb.zsh
# Randomly pick from an array of texts to print when a terminal opens
# options for this array were generated through https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=testall&f=Alpha&t=dumb

# I used the echo command version to generate and modify the text to these variables that store them.
# Modifications include adding a space to the front of the first line and
#   adding a newline character at the end of each string.
# I keep an array containing all the different variable names to randomly select one to echo at the launch of a terminal

# Let the list begin!
